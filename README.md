## Introduction 

Gazealytics is a sophisticated, web-based visual eye tracking analytics toolkit that features a unified combination of gaze analytics features that support flexible exploratory analysis, along with annotation of areas of interest (AOI), time-window of interest (TWI) and filter options based on multiple criteria to visually analyse eye tracking data across time and space. 

Gazealytics features coordinated views unifying spatiotemporal exploration of fixations, saccades and scanpaths for various analytical tasks. It aims to help eye tracking analysts to interactively explore eye tracking data. It allows analysts to visualize their data in various granuarlarity in overview, group, and individual level. Data can be grouped across samples, user-defined AOIs or TWIs to support aggregate or filtered analysis of gaze activity.

It supports a flexible interface for integration into analysts' existing workflow. User-defined samples, AOIs, and TWIs can be imported, where visual metrics results and their coordinated visualizations can be explored on the fly. The interface allows for exporting and restoring snapshot of analysis such as multicriteria parameters, AOIs, metrics, visualizations, and text annotation for post-analysis as well as for reporting purposes.
